##  Vehicle Image Classification using YOLOv8

# This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect and classify different types of vehicles in images


What I Did
I used the YOLOv8 pre-trained model from Ultralytics as a base.

I first tested the pre-trained model on my vehicle image dataset to evaluate initial performance.

Then, I applied transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on my custom dataset.

I trained the model to detect and classify vehicles into five categories:

Bus

Car

Motorcycle

Pickup

Truck

After training, I used the fine-tuned model to perform image detection and visualize results with bounding boxes and labels.
